## ⚙️ How It Works

Yout-ube uses **client-side DOM manipulation** to:
- Inject CSS rules that hide `.ad-container`, `#comments`, `#related`, etc.
- Remove distracting elements without altering network traffic
- Preserve core YouTube functionality (playback, captions, settings)

✅ **No requests are blocked.**  
✅ **No data is sent externally** (unless optional proxy mode is enabled).
