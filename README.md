## ⚙️ How It Works

Ilumu uses **client-side DOM manipulation** to:
- Inject CSS rules that hide `.ad-container`, `#comments`, `#related`, etc.
- Remove distracting elements without altering network traffic
- Preserve core YouTube functionality (playback, captions, settings)

✅ **No requests are blocked.**  
✅ **No data is sent externally.**           
 ✅ **Fully open source.**
